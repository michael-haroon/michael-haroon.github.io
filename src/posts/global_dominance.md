I just want to lay my predictions flat for people to see.

There is a change in world order, as Ray Dalio puts it. I agree with him: at this rate, China is bound to overtake the US.

For most of history and from my understanding, the latest tech was developed and hidden by the government for use of war and defense, while internal competition was mostly for business. Now, the latest tech is developed not by the government, but by internal companies. The US government is currently weak and slow, deep in debt, and behind in the study of (not necessarily the application of) new tech, which makes it heavily reliant on companies. All the while in China, the government has their hands deeply embedded in companies.

If the AI bubble does not pop soon and we don't change our current direction, I predict that the US government will collapse to internal companies and that china will outpace us. Wealth disparity consequently will increase in the States since the business owners will then own the government and not care about the average citizen.
