I'm attending Cyber Camp this week. It has been very informative and incredibley intensive. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone interested in cybersecurity. It's affordable content, and if you don't have a powerful Windows device, be like me and get one off Amazon then return it.

Great resume and career insight, networking opportunity, and educational resource!
