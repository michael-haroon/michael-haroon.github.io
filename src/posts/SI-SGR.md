Today I learned a lot. One is that India consumes an insane amount of silver for noonindustrial uses and ran London dry for it. Another is the relationship between <b>silver futures (SI)</b> and <b>silver-to-gold ratio (SGR)</b>.

&nbsp;

I read an article by some fund manager about how if the **silver-gold ratio (SGR)** is *less than ($<$) 1.3%*, silver prices are poised to increase. I wanted to test this quantitatively, but it seems very rigorous. Instead, we will do a lite analysis. My conclusion: I'd make a very small bet given this signal but I am not certain about it.
