On Oct 10, 2025, I took a silly position: long 1 NVDA Nov 21 185 call with Δ=51. As it was dropping, I was bleeding unrealized money. I realized it was a great opportunity to hedge. I ended up just making my situation complicated: I longed 1 SMH Oct 17 320 put and 1 AMD Nov 21 210 put for a net Δ of -12 and made back what I lost on my NVDA position, albeit as unrealized gains. Hooray!

&nbsp;

...

&nbsp;

My options on AMD and SMH dropped the Monday after and NVDA only made back 50% of what I lost on it. I exited all my positions at a loss.

&nbsp;

Here are a few things I learned in no particular order:

&nbsp;

||| - Understand the theory first. I thought scanning a book about options pricing and understanding the high-level was enough. It wasn't.

&nbsp;

||| - Don't lose money. That is, don't put yourself in a shitty position like I did. I was not allowed to sell AMD and SMH when they were up of because of the PDT rule, even though I understood the business of the AMD and the industry and the basics of directional change of options. I basically locked myself in a room with a randomized bomb.

&nbsp;

||| - Don't be stupid. A lot of this is luck. Bet right, size right. Don't be overconfident and credit your smartness. Manage risk, but don't exit positions out of fear--understand the underlying, your position, and how both behave.

&nbsp;

||| - Lastly, practice with a paper account. Duh.

&nbsp;



Now I wonder, when are options best used? If I post again soon, it will be about options and their greeks. I hypothesize that options are best for when you expect a price change in the underlying AND no one else does.
