Today, I took a silly position: long 1 NVDA Nov 21 185 call at 15 with Δ=51. As it was dropping, I was losing lots of equity and realized it was a great opportunity to hedge. I longed 1 SMH Oct 17 320 put at 3.2 for net Δ of -1 and my portfolio was surprisingly stable. I'll have to look into why. Anyway, I read and watched the news and figured sentiment for the day was at significant low, so I longed 1 AMD Nov 21 210 put at 13.8 for a net Δ of -12 and made back what I lost on my NVDA position.

Call it a partial hedge, but I nonetheless stopped directional effects on my portfolio. If someone can explain better, I'd love to hear it.
